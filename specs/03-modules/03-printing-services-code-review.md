# Printing Services Module — Implementation Review & Handoff

**Branch:** `feature/printing-services`  
**Target:** `develop`  
**Reference:** [03-printing-services.md](./03-printing-services.md)  
**State:** Initial implementation committed; **no PHPUnit/Artisan/MySQL runtime run has been executed through this review**. Not yet approved for PR merge or production.

## Delivered independently of Settings

- New `Modules/PrintingServices` nwidart module, enabled in `modules_statuses.json`.
- Independent module providers, routes, enums, models, migrations, seeders, Actions, FormRequests, resources, select and pricing services.
- `PrintingServiceStatus` (0/1) stored in the service model; `PriceTierActionStatus` (0/1/2/3) is **input-only** for atomic updates.
- Tables: `printing_services` and `printing_service_price_tiers`; reference the already-existing Settings `customer_types` via `parameter_values.id`, not a new customer-type table.
- One service update endpoint accepts unchanged/create/update/delete tier actions and requires `priceTierId` for updates/deletes. Absent stored tiers are retained; failed operations roll back the entire transaction.
- Price precedence: specific customer type + quantity, specific catch-all, generic + quantity, generic catch-all, optional base price. Pricing in EGP; base zero versus null distinct; strict positive tier prices.
- Inclusive, nullable quantity bounds; no overlap in the same tier bucket apart from one catch-all fallback.
- Live service names are normalized for whitespace, compared case-sensitively using a unique SHA-256 live-name key; soft deleting a never-used service frees its name and soft deletes tiers.
- Paginated management list uses only `filter[search]` on name and `filter[status]`; shared select key `printingServices` uses a dedicated read permission.
- PHPUnit feature tests under `Modules/PrintingServices/tests/Feature` and money arithmetic unit tests under `Modules/PrintingServices/tests/Unit`; a separate suite is registered in `phpunit.xml`.
- No modifications to existing Settings/Identity business implementation. Identity's **existing** `RoleSeeder` syncs permissions after module permission seeding.

## Required local verification

Run from the project root on a development/test database (do not run fresh migrations against an unreviewed production database):

```powershell
git fetch origin
git switch feature/printing-services
git pull --ff-only origin feature/printing-services
composer dump-autoload
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan module:list
php artisan migrate:status
php artisan test --testsuite="Printing Services Module"
php artisan test
php artisan route:list --path=api/v1/printing-services
php artisan route:list --path=api/v1/selects
php artisan db:seed --class="Modules\PrintingServices\Database\Seeders\PrintingServicesDatabaseSeeder"
```

**Validation focus:** create with nullable/free base price; positive tiers; lookup group membership; case-sensitive name duplicate protection and reuse after Soft Delete; open and inclusive ranges; catch-all fallback; atomic 0/1/2/3 tier commands; price preview order; names-only filter; no independent tier endpoints; 401/403 permissions.

## Boundaries and integration blockers

1. **Not runtime-verified.** All code additions were made via the connected GitHub repository without the local project/vendor environment, and no PHPUnit results or route output has been observed. Running commands above may reveal additional fixes.
2. **Orders historic-use rule is conditional.** Orders does not exist yet in this project branch. `DeletePrintingServiceAction` currently checks the prospective `order_items.printing_service_id` relation **when that table exists** and fails closed if the table exists without the FK column. Once Orders is built, the owning Orders module must explicitly lock/reference the service on order creation and test the delete/create race across draft/cancelled/soft-deleted order records. Passing Printing Services tests today does not prove this future contract.
3. **Settings customer-type historic protection.** Before integrated usage, Settings must prevent unsafe deletion of customer types referenced by price tiers and agree on deactivation policy, without cascading pricing data.
4. **MySQL concurrency.** SQLite tests do not prove real `lockForUpdate` serialization. Test two competing tier writes, live-name rename/create operations and the service-delete/order-create race against actual MySQL.
5. **Unicode normalization.** Whitespace trimming/collapse and letter-case-sensitive uniqueness are approved. NFC/NFD equivalence is still a technical detail in PS-OPEN-11, to resolve with tests if needed.
6. **Numeric storage.** `DECIMAL(30,2)` and PHP signed integer limits are technical storage boundaries; there is no independent business cap. Test overflow/precision to avoid truncation.
7. **Orders price snapshots.** Orders owns final line total and manual override behavior; these snapshots and update triggers are not new Printing Services columns.

**Review verdict:** Code committed for developer-led tests and review, **not a verified/passing implementation**. Do not merge before tests/migrations/security checks and outstanding cross-module blockers are addressed or explicitly tracked.
